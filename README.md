## Manual Data Collection

If you prefer you can control the time data tracked and disable automatic collection based on your machines activity with the `manual-collection` config flag. In order to manually enter time worked you have to edit the `tail.edn` file in the data dir which contains the most recently collected data. The records have the form: 

```
{
  :time-tracker.store/status :collected
  :time-tracker.store/tz "Europe/Vienna"
  :time-tracker.store/from #inst "2016-06-12T09:34:52.000-00:00"
  :time-tracker.store/to #inst "2016-06-12T14:46:47.000-00:00"
}
```

The format is called [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn).

* Timezone information will be used when entering the tracked time into nettime and does not necessarily have to be the same as in `from` and `to`.
* The status value will change after tracking to either `:tracked` or `:error`
